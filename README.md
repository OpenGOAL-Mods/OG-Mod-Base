# HeroModePlus
All elements in Jak 2 are amplified and the game throws everything it has at you. Adds weapon mods
(note: Mod is not finished, some of the levels are unplayable with weapon mods, very few though)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weapon mods
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 4 Gun Mods are obtainable via missions
- Set to off by default, do (print help) in REPL while connected to learn how to turn on.
- Default gun mod attachment is placed on Yellow Gun for now
- Any mod is attachable to any weapon without cap
- System to select weapon to install mod is not in place yet, waiting on mod-base update
- a random legendary gun mod can be obtained via rare drop from the guards. Only one shall exist in the world

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Green Eco mods (modifiers)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The modifier is randomly selected when weapon-mod-toggle is true.
- these give Jak an overall buff and debuff, only one per save
- Once you turn it on, it can't be turned off for your save.
- Upon loading for the first time in fortress, you will be given the option to choose one or none. (not implemented yet)
- If you choose none, weapon mods will be disabled, too
  (all examples in mod-custom-code.gc, or by using (print help) while connected to the game in REPL)


  These mods aim to make the game more difficult, but hero-mode will only be beaten by the worthy.
